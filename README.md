# 👋 Hi, I'm Martin Fischer

I'm a frontend developer based in Norway but open to explore the world. I am currently transitioning from a background in teaching to the exciting world of development. I bring strong communication skills, a user-focused mindset, and a passion for clean, accessible code.  

After years in the classroom, I decided to pursue my long-standing interest in technology. Today, I enjoy building responsive, inclusive, and maintainable web interfaces — and I’m constantly learning to improve my skills and broaden my toolset.
